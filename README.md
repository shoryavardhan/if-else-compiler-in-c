Through this project we are trying to implement the if-else compiler i.e, for any input.c file our proposed solution will be able to find out whether the code is syntactically as well as semantically correct and then will be able to visualise the major steps of a compiler i.e, lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis and intermediate code generation.

To compile this project: 
step 1. Clone this repository
step 2. cd into the repository
step 3. Open terminal
step 4. type sh compile.sh
